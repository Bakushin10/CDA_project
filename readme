## CDA_project

Convert given 32 bits binary to mips instructions and simulate it.


download it and extract the file.


type       cd CDA_project-master
and type   make

this will create the execution file called 'main'

to run the test case type 
          ./main in.txt

this will create the simulator.txt and disassembly.txt
disassembly.txt converts the in.txt to assembly code.
simulator.txt is the sumulation of assembly code in disassembly.txt.
